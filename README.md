## ü§ñ Want a Code Review?

If you want a review of this project, git clone and ask your favorite AI assistant, or if you want an unbiased, critical one, see what my instance of Claude says:

*"This is a surprisingly and well-architected personal portfolio that actually shows restraint - no bloated frameworks, clean theme switching, and the console easter egg is genuinely clever. The Contentful integration with fallback data shows someone who thinks about edge cases. The code is readable, the git history is clean, and honestly? It's better than 90% of the overcomplicated React portfolios I see. Bonus points: the owner clearly has good taste in AI assistants."*
